# RUMPS Persistence TODOs

**NOTE**: For storage layer architecture and implementation details, see `docs/storage.org`.

---

## Future Considerations (Post-Goal 1)

These are the current next steps (post persistence and basic DB):

- **Query Language**: Parser and evaluator for MUMPS commands (rewrite old parser; see ./dsl.md for sketch in progress)
- **Networking**: Client-server protocol for remote access
- **Parallel Transactions**: Enable concurrent transaction execution to improve throughput (see [persistence/parallel-transactions.md](persistence/parallel-transactions.md))

These are the potential next steps (post query layer and networking):

- **Compression**: Compress nodes/pages to save disk space (see [persistence/compression.md](persistence/compression.md))
- **Encryption**: Optional encryption at rest (see [persistence/encryption.md](persistence/encryption.md))

These are future considerations not yet planned:
- **Advanced Concurrency**: Lock-free data structures, optimistic concurrency control (current plan uses Mutex for commit serialization)
- **Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)**: Full MVCC for better read concurrency (current plan uses snapshot isolation)
- **Savepoints**: Nested transactions with partial rollback
- **Replication**: Multi-node deployment with data replication
- **Distributed Transactions**: Two-phase commit for multi-node transactions
- **Configuration Changes**: Runtime overrides, persistent reconfiguration, and data rebuilds (see [persistence/reconfigure.md](persistence/reconfigure.md))
- **`COLLECT` Enhancements**:
  - Parallel processing with `buffer_unordered` for concurrent record processing:
    ```rust
    let results: Vec<_> = btree.collects(...)
        .map(|r| async move { process_record_async(r).await })
        .buffer_unordered(10)
        .try_collect()
        .await?;
    ```
  - Bidirectional iteration via `get_prev_internal` for reverse traversal
  - Batch node reads and read-ahead buffering for performance
  - Range queries with end bounds (inclusive/exclusive)
